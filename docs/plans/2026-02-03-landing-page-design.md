# Still Kettle Landing Page Design

> Draft created: 2026-02-03

---

## Goals

- **Showcase products** — Feature Stella prominently, tease upcoming work
- **Build credibility** — Indie maker story + mission-driven vision
- **Subtle collaboration invitation** — Open to like-minded builders without actively promoting as a collective

## Approach

**Philosophy-first:** Lead with the vision/why, then show Stella as proof it works. Future products implied but not detailed.

---

## Page Structure

### Section 1: Hero

**Purpose:** Set the tone, establish brand essence

```
stillkettle

# Good things take time to brew

We build the tools we always needed — now possible — without noise.
```

- Lowercase wordmark (humility, calm confidence)
- No CTA buttons — let the page breathe, CTAs come after context
- Subheadline from brand framework: clear, no hype

---

### Section 2: Philosophy / Story

**Purpose:** Establish the "why" before showing "what"

```
AI has changed what's possible. Tools that once required teams can now be built by one person with a clear vision.

We're not chasing trends or building for investors. We make software for ourselves first — then share it with others who feel the same friction.

Simple tools. Thoughtfully made. No noise.
```

- Acknowledges the AI moment without hype
- Indie maker authenticity — "built for ourselves"
- Brand essence distilled
- Subtle community hint ("others who feel the same friction")

---

### Section 3: Products

**Purpose:** Show what we're making — proof of the philosophy

```
## What we're making

**Stella**
Scans your Gmail for invoices and extracts the data — so you don't have to.
A Chrome extension for freelancers, small teams, and anyone tired of manual bookkeeping.
[Try Stella →]

**Coming soon**
Something new is brewing.
[Get notified →]

More tools are brewing.
```

- "What we're making" — active, workshop feel
- Stella: pain point focus, not feature list
- Upcoming: vague tease, optional email capture
- "More brewing" ties to kettle metaphor

---

### Section 4: About / Maker Story

**Purpose:** Human credibility + subtle collaboration invitation

```
## Behind the kettle

Still Kettle is a small, independent studio.

We're builders who got tired of waiting for the right tools to exist — so we started making them. AI made it possible. Stubbornness made it happen.

If you're someone who notices friction others ignore, who sketches solutions on napkins, who builds before asking permission — we'd like to hear from you.

[Say hello →]
```

- "Behind the kettle" — warm, keeps metaphor
- "Small, independent studio" — indie without limiting to solo
- Collaboration invitation speaks to a type of person, not "we're hiring"
- "Say hello" softer than "Contact us"

---

### Section 5: Footer

**Purpose:** Minimal, functional

```
hello@stillkettle.com

**Optional sign-off:**
```

```

- No navigation clutter
- Email as plain text (more human)
- No social links unless active presence
